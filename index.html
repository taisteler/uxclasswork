    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    </p>Hello, I am Tia-Tamera Lester, an aspiring Product Designer. My background is in Cyber Security, but through hands on training I have learned design research, wireframing, prototyping, and various coding languages.

        Hi! Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Tia-Tamer Lester. I’m a Clevelander born and raised (Go Cavs!), but I’ve relocated to the Queen City aka Charlotte. I’m a cat and dog mom, so I spend my days fussing at one of them to stop destroying the house. My favorite places are the beach, the mountains, cozy coffee shops, and in a plane headed to a new place. Anything else you’d like to know about me? Contact me! Thanks for stopping by.

I’ve always wanted to learn what UX is and it’s importance. Bridging the gap between the innovation and the bottom line IS UX.  

You might mention what sets you apart from others, something unique about you.

You could also mention your ideal type of client, location, and how long you’ve been a designer.
